# Production Engineering - Week 1 - Portfolio Site

Welcome to the MLH Fellowship! During Week 1, you'll be working with Flask to build a portfolio site. This site will be the foundation for activities we do in future weeks so spend time this week making it your own and reflect your personality!

## Tasks

Once you've got your portfolio downloaded and running using the instructions below, you should attempt to complete the following tasks.

For each of these tasks, you should create an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and work on them in a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches). When the task has been completed, you should open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) and get another fellow in your pod to give you feedback before merging it in.

*Note: Make sure to include a link to the Issue you're working on inside of your Pull Request so your reviewer knows what you're working on!*
